function,"A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action", www.tutorialspoint.com
tuples,"Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets", www.tutorialspoint.com
variable,"Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.", www.tutorialspoint.com
argument,"An argument is a value provided to a function when you call it", http://stackoverflow.com
parameter,"Parameter is data sent to one function from another", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
global variable,"Global variable is a variable defined in the "main" program. A variable is defined the first time it appears on the left-hand-side of an assignment statement", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
local variable,"Local variable is a variable defined within a function. Local variables are temporary, scratch memory. When a function completes, its local variables are de-allocated (they die!)", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
scalar,"Scalar is an atomic single-item value or variable. Integers, floating point numbers, strings, and booleans are types of scalars", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
object,"Multi-item data, such as a Python list. We'll also learn object-oriented programming and how to define objects with named sub-items", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
integer,"An integer is a whole number. An integer is generally stored in 4 bytes, or 32 bits", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
float,"A floating point number is a number with decimal points, e.g., 34.56. A floating point number is stored in 8 bytes", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
character,"A character is a symbol on the keyboard. A character is generally stored in 2 bytes. ASCII and Unicode are protocols for how symbols are mapped to numbers", "WEB PROGRAMMING" website by USF professor David Wolber
dictionary,"Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}.", www.tutorialspoint.com
ascii table,"ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character.", www.asciitable.com
module, "A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.", www.tutorialspoint.com
